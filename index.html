          <br />
          <p>
             Bhim Rao Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891. He was the 14th and
          youngest child of his parents. His father, Subedar Ramji Maloji
          Sakpal, served in the British Army and was a follower of Sant Kabir.
          He was well educated and strongly believed in discipline and learning.
          When Dr. Ambedkar was just two years old, his father retired from
          service. At the age of six, he lost his mother. After this tragic
          loss, his aunt took care of him. He received his early education in
          Bombay and later studied in Satara. From childhood itself, Babasaheb
          faced severe discrimination and untouchability. These painful
          experiences deeply influenced his thoughts and later reforms.

            Despite social hardships, Dr. Ambedkar continued his studies with dedication. He completed his schooling under difficult conditions where he faced discrimination from teachers and classmates.

            He completed his graduation from Elphinstone College, Bombay. During this time, he received a scholarship from Maharaja Sayajirao Gaikwad of Baroda, which helped him pursue higher education.
