        13 APR 2023 4:14PM by PIB Delhi Baba Saheb Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar was
        born on April 14, 1891, he was the 14th and last child of his parents.
        Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar was the son of Subedar Ramji Maloji Sakpal. He
        was Subedar in British Army. Babasaheb’s father was a follower of Sant
        Kabir and was also a well-read person. Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was
        hardly two years old when his father retired from service. His mother
        died when he was only about six. Babasaheb got his early education in
        Bombay. Since his school days he realized with intense shock what it was
        to be an untouchable in India. Dr. Ambedkar was taking his school
        education in Satara. Unfortunately, Dr. Ambedkar lost his mother. His
        aunt looked after him. Afterwards, they shifted to Bombay. Throughout
        his school education, he suffered from the curse of untouchability. His
        marriage took place after his matriculation in 1907 in an open shed of a
        market. Dr. Ambedkar completed his graduation at Elphinston College,
        Bombay, for which he was getting a scholarship from His Highness
        Sayajirao Gaikwad of Baroda. After his graduation, he had to join Baroda
        Sansthan according to the bond. He lost his father when he was in
        Baroda, 1913 is the year when Dr. Ambedkar was selected as a scholar to
        go to U.S.A, for the higher studies. This was the turning point of his
        educational career. He got his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Columbia
        University in 1915 and 1916 respectively. He then left for London for
        further studies. He was admitted there to the Gray’s Inn for Law and
        also allowed to prepare for the D. Sc. at the London School of Economics
        and Political Science. But he was called back to India by the Dewan of
        Baroda. Later, he got his Bar-at-Law and D.Sc. degree also. He studied
        for some time at Bonn University in Germany. In 1916 he read an essay on
        ‘Castes in India — their Mechanism, Genesis, and Development’. In 1916,
        he wrote his thesis ‘National dividend for India — A Historic and
        Analytical Study’ and got his Ph.D. Degree. This was published after
        eight years under the title — “Evolution of Provincial Finance in
        British India.” Then after getting this highest degree, he returned to
        India and was appointed a Military Secretary to the Maharaja of Baroda
        with a view to groom him as the finance minister in the long run.
        Babasaheb returned to the city in September, 1917 as his scholarship
        tenure ended and joined the service. But after a brief stay in the city
        till November, 1917, he left for Mumbai. The maltreatment he faced on
        grounds of untouchability had forced him to leave the service. Dr.
        Ambedkar returned to Bombay and joined Sydenham College as a Professor
        of Political Economy. As he was well read, he was very popular among the
        students. But he resigned his post, to resume his studies in Law and
        Economics in London. Maharaja of Kolhapur gave him the financial help.
        In 1921, he wrote his thesis. “Provincial Decentralization of Imperial
        Finance in British India,’ and got his M.Sc. Degree from the London
        University. Then he spent some period in Bonn University in Germany. In
        1923, he submitted his thesis — “Problem of Rupee its Origin and
        Solution”, for the D.Sc. Degree. He was called to Bar in 1923. After
        coming back from England in 1924 he started an Association for the
        welfare of the depressed classes, with Sir Chimanlal Setalvad as the
        President and Dr. Ambedkar as the Chairman. To spread education, improve
        economic conditions and represent the grievances of depressed classes
        were the immediate objects of the Association. The Bahiskrit Bharat,
        newspaper was started in April 3, 1927 to address the cause of the
        depressed classes in view of the new reform. In 1928, he became a
        Professor in Government Law College, Bombay and on June 1, 1935 he
        became the Principal of the same college and remained in that position
        till his resignation in 1938. On October 13, 1935, a provincial
        conference of the depressed classes was held a Yeola in Nasik District.
        In this conference, he gave the shock to the Hindus by announcing. “I
        was born in Hinduism but I will not die as a Hindu” Thousands of his
        followers supported his decision. In 1936 he addressed the Bombay
        Presidency Mahar Conference and advocated the renunciation of Hinduism.
        On August 15, 1936, he formed Independent Labour Party to safeguard the
        interest of the depressed classes, which mostly formed the labour
        population. In 1938, Congress introduced a bill making change in the
        name of untouchables. Dr. Ambedkar criticized it. In his point of view
        changing the name is not the solution of the problem. In 1942, he was
        appointed to the Executive Council of the Governor General of India as a
        Labour member, in 1946, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly from
        Bengal. At the same time he published his book, Who were Shudras? After
        Independence, in 1947, he was appointed as a Minister of Law and Justice
        in Nehru’s first cabinet. But in 1951, he resigned his ministership,
        expressing his differences on the Kashmir issue, India’s Foreign Policy
        and Nehru’s Policy towards the Hindu Code Bill. In 1952, Columbia
        University conferred upon him the degree of LL.D. in recognition of the
        work done by him in connection with the drafting of India’s
        Constitution. In 1955, he published his book titled Thoughts on
        Linguistic States. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was awarded a Doctorate on January
        12, 1953, from Osmania University. Ultimately after 21 years, he proved
        true, what he had announced in Yeola in 1935, that “I will not die as a
        Hindu”. On 14th Oct. 1956, he embraced Buddhism in a historic ceremony
        in Nagpur and died on 6th Dec. 1956. Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar was conferred
        with the title of “Bodhisattva” by the Buddhist monks at “Jagatik
        Buddhism Council” in 1954 in Kathmandu, Nepal. The special thing is that
        Dr Ambedkar was conferred with the title of Bodhisattva while he was
        alive. He also contributed to India’s Independence struggle and in its
        reforms post-independence. Apart from this, Babasaheb played a
        significant role in the formation of the Reserve Bank of India. The
        Central bank was formed on the concept presented by Babasaheb to the
        Hilton Young Commission. This sparkling life history of Dr. Ambedkar
        shows that he was a man of study and action. Firstly, he acquired sound
        knowledge of Economics Politics, Law, Philosophy and Sociology, in
        pursuing his studies; he had to face many social odds. But he did not
        spend all his life in reading and studying and in the libraries. He
        refused the higher posts with attractive salaries because he never
        forgot his brothers in the depressed class. He dedicated the rest of his
        life for equality, brotherhood and humanity. He tried his best for the
        upliftment of the depressed classes.
